# Python - Import & Modules

Welcome to the Python - Import & Modules project. In this projects, we explore the intricacies of importing functions, creating modules, and leveraging various Python features. The project emphasizes a comprehensive understanding of module management and practical applications.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file

`0-add.py`: This Python script imports the function `def add(a, b):` from `add_0.py` and demonstrates the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`.

### 1. My first toolbox!

`1-calculation.py`: A Python program showcasing the importation of functions from `calculator_1.py`. It prints the results of arithmetic operations on the values 10 and 5.

### 2. How to make a script dynamic!

`2-args.py`: An insightful Python script displaying the number and list of arguments passed to it, enhancing script dynamism.

### 3. Infinite addition

`3-infinite_add.py`: This Python script calculates and prints the result of the addition of all its arguments.

### 4. Who are you?

`4-hidden_discovery.py`: A Python script revealing all names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc` in alphabetical order, excluding names starting with '__'.

### 5. Everything can be imported

`5-variable_load.py`: A Python script showcasing the importation of the variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and printing its value.

### 6. Build my own calculator!

`100-my_calculator.py`: A robust Python program that imports functions from `calculator_1.py` to handle basic operations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 7. Easy print

`101-easy_print.py`: A simple yet effective Python program that prints `#pythoniscool` to the standard output without using conventional print statements.

### 8. ByteCode -> Python #3

`102-magic_calculation.py`: An intriguing Python function designed to match a specific bytecode provided by Holberton School.

### 9. Fast alphabet

`103-fast_alphabet.py`: A Python program demonstrating the printing of the alphabet in uppercase without using common constructs like loops, conditionals, `str.join()`, string literals, or system calls.

Feel free to explore and utilize these tasks as building blocks for your Python journey. Enjoy coding!
