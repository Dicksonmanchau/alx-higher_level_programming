# Python Mastery: if/else, loops, functions

Welcome to my Python mastery project! ðŸš€ In this journey, I explore the foundational concepts of Python, mastering conditionals, loops, and functions. Brace yourself as we dive into the world of `if`, `if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, `range`, `while`, and `for` loops. Along the way, we'll unravel the secrets of variable scope, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

## ðŸ“ƒ Task Highlights

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing (mandatory)

**0-positive_or_negative.py**: Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive or negative. Prints the number followed by:
- If the number is greater than 0: "is positive"
- If the number is 0: "is zero"
- If the number is less than 0: "is negative"
Followed by a new line. Completion of this source code.

### 1. The last digit (mandatory)

**1-last_digit.py**: Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints its last digit. Prints the string "Last digit of [number] is [last_digit]" followed by:
- If the number is greater than 5: "and is greater than 5"
- If the number is 0: "and is 0"
- If the number is less than 6 and not 0: "and is less than 6 and not 0"
Followed by a new line. Completion of this source code.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game (mandatory)

**2-print_alphabet.py**: Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Using only one print and one loop. Storing characters in variables or importing modules not allowed.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off (mandatory)

**3-print_alphabt.py**: Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Using only one print and one loop. Without storing characters in variables or importing modules. Prints every letter except for 'q' and 'e'.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing (mandatory)

**4-print_hexa.py**: Python program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal. Using only one print and one loop. Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules. Printing format: "[decimal] = [hexadecimal]"

### 5. 00...99 (mandatory)

**5-print_comb2.py**: Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 two digits each. Numbers are separated by ", " except for the last number, which is followed by a new line. Using no more than two print functions and one loop. Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules.

### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need (mandatory)

**6-print_comb3.py**: Python program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order. Numbers are separated by ", " except for the last number, which is followed by a new line. The two digits must be different - 01 and 10 are considered identical. Using no more than three print functions and two loops. Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules.

### 7. islower (mandatory)

**7-islower.py**: Python function that checks for lowercase characters. Returns True if `c` is lowercase, False otherwise. Without importing modules or using `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`.

### 8. To uppercase (mandatory)

**8-uppercase.py**: Python function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. Using no more than two print functions and one loop. Without importing modules or using `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`.

### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important (mandatory)

**9-print_last_digit.py**: Python function that prints the last digit of a number. Returns the value of the last digit. Without
